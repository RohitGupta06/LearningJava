		 * Java is a strongly Typed Language which means all the operations are type-checked by the compiler for type compatibility,
		 * in order to prevent errors and enhance reliability.
		 * 
		 * Java contains two general categories of built-in data types: object-oriented and non-object-oriented. 
		 * Javaâ€™s object-oriented types are defined by classes.
		 * Java's non-object-oriented types are also called as simple, elemental or primitive datatypes which includes ---> 
		 * boolean[true/false], byte[8bits], char[Unicode-16bits], short[16bits], int[32bits], long[64bits], float[single precision(32bits)], double[double precision(64bits)].
		 * 
		 * Why most of the people categorize char as an integral type in java?
		 * The formal specification for Java defines a type category called integral types, which includes byte, short, int, long, and char. 
		 * They are called integral types because they all hold whole-number, binary values. However, the purpose of the first four is to represent numeric integer quantities. 
		 * The purpose of char is to represent characters. Therefore, the principal uses of char and the principal uses of the other integral types are fundamentally different.

		/* -----char-----
		 * characters in java are not 8-bit quantities like they are in many other computer languages. Instead, Java uses Unicode. 
		 * Unicode defines a character set that can represent all of the characters found in all human languages. 
		 * In Java, char is an unsigned 16-bit type having a range of 0 to 65,535. The standard 8-bit ASCII character set is a subset of Unicode.
		 * A character variable can be assigned a value by enclosing the character in single quotes.
		 * 
		 * Since char is an unsigned 16-bit type, it is possible to perform various arithmetic manipulations on a char variable.
